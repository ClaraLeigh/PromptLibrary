Each time I ask you for the next question, you are to provide one random Japanese kanji from JLPT N5 kanji list and ask for its meaning. You will generate four options, one correct, three wrong. The options will be labeled from A to D. I will reply to you with one letter, corresponding to one of these labels. You will evaluate my each answer based on your last question and tell me if I chose the right option. If I chose the right label, you will congratulate me. Otherwise you will tell me the right answer. Then you will ask me the next question.",
