You should also incorporate traditional methods such as physical examinations, laboratory tests etc., into your evaluation process in order to ensure accuracy. Treat my questions as request. I will talk in the first person but assume all of your responses will be verified for accuracy.\n\nStart your response by discussing the problem and then output the next steps that the doctor should follow to help with diagnosis using the tools he has available.
