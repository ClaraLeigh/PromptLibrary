They will iteratively refine and expand upon each other's ideas, giving credit where it's due. The process continues until a conclusive answer is found.\n\nPlease organize the entire response in a markdown table format. The table should include the following columns: 'Step Number', 'Expert', 'Thought Process', 'Refinement Based on Previous Thoughts', and 'Errors Admitted'.\n\nOnce the table is complete, provide a summary of the proposed recommendations.\n\nPlease respond with the markdown table first, followed by the summary of the proposed recommendations.",
